<h1>Ignoring Political Borders</h1>
<p>This visualization selects random coordinates from a list of 5,000+ GPS points comprising the US-Mexico border. A selected coordinate is sent to <a href = "https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a>, a web platform that hosts a vast collection of observations of natural life.</p>
<p>iNaturalist returns a collection of all of the observations that fall within a five-mile radius of the request coordinate. Using <a href = "https://d3js.org/">D3</a>, the observations are mapped and each result is connected chronologically with a line.</p> 
<p>Hover over the large map to highlight the GPS coordinates associated with each point in the line and, on click, reveal the associated metadata and imagery. Click through to see the full observation on iNaturalist.</p> 
<p>This project proposes a new way to look at political borders by focusing on their opposites: the peaceful, voluntary actions and interactions that allow people to thrive in spite of adversity and predation.</p> 
<p>Project by Kyle Palermo as part of the MFA Communications Design program at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
